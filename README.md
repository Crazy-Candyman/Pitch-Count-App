# Baseball Pitch Counter âš¾

## About the Project

This web app is a simple baseball pitch counter where you can log the number of pitches thrown by pitchers. The app
features a count for both, the Home and Away teams. The pitches are logged and saved via local storage and it will be
displayed even if you refresh the web app or switch sides. To reset the counter, click "New Pitcher", it will only reset
the count for the current side that is being displayed.
